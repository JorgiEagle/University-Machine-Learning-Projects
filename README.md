# University-Machine-Learning-Projects
2 machine learning projects completed as part of the module: Introduction to Machine Learning, COMP24111

The first project is a KNN classifer for identifying documents.

The second is a regression model for facial detection.

Both projects are styled a Jupyter Notebooks. While the notebooks were provided with instructions, all code written within is my own work
